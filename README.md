# Lectures and Livecode for Batch #468

You'll find here all things that teachers will do during fullstack bootcamp.

Everytime a teacher will write some code for lectures and / or livecodes, he will then commit and push it here.

Then you can easily get back on your computer what teacher did.

## Getting back new content on your computer

```bash
  cd ~/code/your_github_username/batch-578
  git pull origin master
```

ðŸš€ Enjoy !
