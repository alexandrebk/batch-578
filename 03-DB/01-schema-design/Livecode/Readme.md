# Jukebox, Extended

We will start from an extended database schema called "ChinookDatabase" with some information about Playlists and Customers (like iTunes has).

1. Map the new tables on the Database Schema
2. Write the SQL queries to answer these questions:
  1. List all customers (name + email), ordered alphabetically (no extra information)
  2. List tracks (Name + Composer) of the Classical playlist
  3. List the 10 artists mostly listed in all playlists
  4. List the tracks which have been purchased at least twice, ordered by number of purchases
